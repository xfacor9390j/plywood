                During World War II, the army needed a lot of timber but it was in short supply. My father kept our door and kitchen open to all army personnel. He said this was the least we could do; Generals, Captains, and Jawaan’s alike were risking their lives. A group of fifteen came for Diwali-dinner in 1945. 
                After a hearty dinner of over 150 puri’s and accompaniments, they got talking.
                They shared both heart-warming as well as gut-wrenching stories. They asked if we could organise a large supply of woolens for them. “Consider it done” my father said in his deep voice. They joked “Can you organise large supplies of timber also.” After an hour of discussions, the entrepreneur in my father realised this was a good opportunity; it was a win-win, and he had willing customers. 
                Six months later, in the midst of the war, Bawri Timber Industries was borne.

                Before setting up Nagaland Plywood, we realized manufacturers were using only two types of timber (makai and halong) to make plywood.
                 We pioneered using underexplored varieties of timber. Plywood was made in 3, 5, or 7 layers. Manufacturers used th
                 e same quality of timber for the inner and outer layers, and made all the layers equal in thickness. We innovated using
                  superior timber only for the outer
                 layers and also pioneered making the inner layers of timber twice as thick as the outer layers.
